Stop struggling with WordPress's default restrictions on vector graphics. As a designer or developer, you need the flexibility of RAW files for crisp, scalable visuals, but WordPress blocks them by default due to their XML-based nature. RAW Support by thisismyurl.com solves this by safely unlocking RAW uploads so you can focus on building beautiful, responsive sites without technical roadblocks.

The plugin is designed with a **Non-Destructive** architecture, ensuring it is active immediately upon installation while remaining completely clean upon uninstallation.
