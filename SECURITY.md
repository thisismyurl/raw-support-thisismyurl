## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.** If you discover a security-related issue, we want to fix it immediately. To ensure the safety of our users, we ask that you report vulnerabilities privately so we can address them before they are made public.

You can report security concerns via:

* **Email:** cross@thisismyurl.com
* **Contact Form:** [https://thisismyurl.com/contact](https://thisismyurl.com/contact)

### What to include in your report:
* A brief description of the vulnerability.
* Steps to reproduce the issue (proof-of-concept).
* The potential impact if exploited.

### Our Commitment
We take every report seriously. Upon receiving your report:
1. We will acknowledge receipt within **48 hours**.
2. We will provide a timeline for the fix and keep you updated on our progress.
3. Once the fix is released, we will give you full credit for the discovery in our release notes (unless you prefer to remain anonymous).

## A Note for Researchers
We are a community-focused project. While we cannot currently offer a financial "bug bounty," we are deeply grateful for your help in keeping our users safe and are happy to provide public recognition for your contributions.
