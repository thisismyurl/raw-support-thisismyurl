Privacy Policy for {plugin_name}
Your privacy is a priority. This document outlines exactly what data is handled by [Plugin Name], how it is used, and���more importantly���what is not collected.

1. No Default Tracking
By default, {plugin_name} is a "privacy-first" plugin.

It does not track your website visitors.

It does not collect personal data from your database.

It does not "phone home" with usage statistics or server information.

2. Data Collection Upon Registration
The only exception to the "no-tracking" rule occurs if you voluntarily choose to Register the plugin.

When you register, the plugin sends a request to our License API at thisismyurl.com. This request includes:

Your Website URL: This is used solely to validate your registration status and ensure your site is authorized to receive updates or support.

No other information (such as admin email addresses, user counts, or IP addresses) is transmitted during this process.

3. Third-Party Connections
This plugin connects to external servers only for the following purposes:

License Validation: Connecting to thisismyurl.com to verify your registration.

WordPress.org: Standard connections made by the WordPress core to check for plugin updates.

4. Cookies and Local Storage
This plugin does not set any cookies on your website visitors' browsers. It may store small configuration settings in your own WordPress database (the wp_options table) to remember your plugin preferences, but this data never leaves your server.

5. Your Rights & Data Deletion
Since we do not collect personal information, there is no "user profile" to delete. However, if you wish to revoke your registration and have your URL removed from our licensing database:

Disconnect/Unregister the plugin from your WordPress dashboard.

Contact us via thisismyurl.com/contact to request the manual removal of your URL from our records.
