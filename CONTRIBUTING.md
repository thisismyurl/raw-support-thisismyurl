# Contributing to WebP Support by thisismyurl

First off, thank you for considering contributing! It���������s people like you who make the WordPress community such a vibrant, helpful place.

## Our Mission
This plugin isn't just a tool; it's part of a larger mission. The proceeds and efforts behind this project help fund **mentorship for at-risk youth** and support **underrepresented communities** entering the tech space. By contributing code, documentation, or translations, you are helping sustain an environment where everyone has a chance to learn and grow.

## Ways You Can Help

### 1. Mentorship & Documentation
Because we use this codebase as a teaching tool for new developers, **clear documentation is our highest priority.** * If you see a comment that is confusing, help us clarify it.
* If you can write a "How-to" guide for a specific feature, that helps our students immensely.

### 2. Reporting Bugs
* Check the [Issues tab](https://github.com/thisismyurl/raw-support-thisismyurl/issues) to see if the bug has already been reported.
* If not, open a new issue. Please include steps to reproduce the bug and your environment details (WordPress version, PHP version).

### 3. Code Contributions
We welcome Pull Requests (PRs) for bug fixes and new features!
* **Branching:** Please create a new branch for your work (e.g., `fix/header-spacing` or `feature/new-shortcode`).
* **Coding Standards:** We follow [WordPress Coding Standards](https://developer.wordpress.org/coding-standards/wordpress-coding-standards/php/).
* **Commit Messages:** Keep them descriptive. (e.g., "Fix: Resolved CSS conflict with Twenty Twenty-Five theme").

### 4. Translations
We want this plugin to be accessible to everyone. If you speak a language other than English, your help with translations via [translate.wordpress.org](https://translate.wordpress.org/) is highly valued.

## The Pull Request Process
1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests!
3. Ensure your code adheres to the `.editorconfig` settings.
4. Submit the PR with a brief description of your changes and how they align with the plugin's goals.
5. We will review your PR as soon as possible (usually within 3���������5 business days).
